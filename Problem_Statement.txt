Problem Statement
------------------
The Little Lemon mobile website currently lacks an online table reservation feature, which creates friction for users who want to book in advance.
This inconvenience can lead to lost customers and missed opportunities. This project aims to design and implement an accessible and user-friendly
"Reserve a Table" feature, allowing users to book a table by selecting the date, time, and number of guestsâ€”all through an intuitive mobile experience.
