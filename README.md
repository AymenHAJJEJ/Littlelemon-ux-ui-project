# Little Lemon – Reserve a Table (UX/UI Final Project)

This project is a UX/UI design prototype for Little Lemon, a fictional Mediterranean restaurant. It was created as the final assessment for the Coursera Front-End Developer Capstone project.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The Little Lemon mobile website currently lacks an online table reservation feature. This creates inconvenience for users who prefer to book in advance without making a phone call. This project designs a simple and accessible "Reserve a Table" flow to enhance the user experience and reduce friction.

## 🧑‍🎨 UX Deliverables
